          <p>The place is named after Dona Paula Amaral Antónia de Souto Maior, a historical figure in Portuguese India. She was related to the Portuguese Viceroy of Jaffnapatnam in Sri Lanka. She and her family arrived in Goa in 1744 and she married a hidalgo from Spain in 1756. Her father was Dom António Caetano de Menezes Souto Maior. They were an extremely affluent family, and the entire property from the present-day Cabo Raj Nivas all the way to Caranzalem belonged to the Souto Maior family. She died on 21 December 1782.</p></div>

          <p>This may be the smallest of all the wildlife sanctuaries in Goa but it is certainly one of the finest in the region for several reasons. It lies in the Ponda region and is well situated slightly away from the coast covering quite a decent distance of about 8 sq. km long natural reserve and it is gracefully set amidst lush green Western Ghats. </p></div>

          <p>Sitting in the Western Ghats of the country, Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is best known for its delicate ecosystem. Visited mostly by the students of Botany, the variety of trees and shrubs found in this sanctuary is simply mind-blowing.
